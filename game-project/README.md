# Game Project README

## Project Overview
- Create a 2D platformer game where the player controls a character to overcome obstacles.
- The game will have multiple levels of increasing difficulty.
- Include a scoring system to track player progress.
- Implement a game over screen with the option to restart.

## Features to Include
- Character movement using arrow keys or WASD.
- Jumping mechanics to navigate platforms.
- Collision detection with obstacles.
- Collectible items for bonus points.
- Enemies to add challenge and excitement.

## Enhancements and Improvements
- Add a timer to create a sense of urgency.
- Implement power-ups for the character.
- Include a level editor for players to create custom levels.
- Integrate a leaderboard for high scores.
- Enhance graphics and animations for a visually appealing game.

## Programming Languages
- C++ will be used for developing the game due to its performance and flexibility in implementing complex game logic.

## APIs
- OpenGL will be used for graphics rendering to create visually appealing 2D graphics.
- SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) will be integrated for handling audio playback and user input, enhancing the user experience.

## Packages and Libraries
- OpenGL version 4.6 will be utilized to take advantage of the latest graphics features and optimizations.
- SDL version 2.0.14 will be used for cross-platform compatibility and efficient multimedia handling.

## Rationale for Technical Choices
- Using C++ allows for efficient memory management and performance optimization crucial for game development.
- OpenGL provides a powerful framework for rendering graphics, essential for creating an engaging visual experience.
- SDL simplifies handling user input and audio playback, streamlining the development process.

## Project Structure
- Implement classes for player, obstacles, collectibles, enemies, and game levels to maintain a structured codebase.
- Utilize inheritance and polymorphism to represent game entities and behaviors efficiently.
- Separate game logic from rendering code to improve maintainability and scalability.

## Game Development Process
- Begin by creating a basic game loop to handle user input, update game state, and render graphics.
- Implement collision detection algorithms to handle interactions between game entities accurately.
- Integrate sound effects and background music to enhance the overall gaming experience.
